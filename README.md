## About

Maxiploit was created to serve three purposes:

**Maxiploit is a server-client debugging tool which logs all TCP-UDP traffic including incorrect and fraudulent packet detection system between your server and the client.**

1. To act as a software to test online game server files.

2. To provide a strong security, protection and privacy software for any online game project that requires a server-client architecture. 

3. Instead of writing long and complex code every time, it provides the easiest and strongest way.

## Branches

We publish source for the **[Maxiploit]** in three rolling branches:

We publish source for the engine in three rolling branches:

The **[release branch](https://github.com/dentrax/Maxiploit/tree/release)** is extensively tested by our QA team and makes a great starting point for learning the Maxiploit.

The **[promoted branch](https://github.com/dentrax/Maxiploit/tree/promoted)** is updated with builds for our team members to use. It's a good balance between getting the latest cool stuff and knowing most things work.

The **[master branch](https://github.com/dentrax/Maxiploit/tree/master)** tracks [live changes](https://github.com/dentrax/Maxiploit/commits/master) by our Maxiploit team. 
This is the cutting edge and may be buggy - it may not even compile.

Other short-lived branches may pop-up from time to time as we stabilize new releases or hotfixes.
